# Portfolio-Optimization-using-ML
Portfolio Optimization Using Machine Learning M.Sc Final Semester Project (Ongoing)
Prof: N. Selvaraju, Department of Mathematics, IIT Guwahati 
• Extracted and preprocessed financial data from the ProwessIQ database for stock return analysis.
• Implemented multiple machine learning models, including Random Forest Regressor, XGBoost, Support Vector Re-
gression (SVR), AdaBoost, Neural Networks, to predict monthly stock returns.
• Optimized model performance using hyperparameter tuning, cross-validation, and feature selection to improve predic-
tive accuracy while preventing overfitting.
• Developed an asset allocation strategy by applying machine learning-based return predictions to portfolio optimization,
aiming for maximum return with minimum risk.
• Evaluated model performance using metrics such as MAE, MSE, and R² to ensure robust and reliable forecasting.
• Visualized stock trends and model results using Matplotlib and Seaborn to derive actionable insights.
